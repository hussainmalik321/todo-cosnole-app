## Prompt

```text
Project Name: Phase-1 Todo In-Memory Console App

Purpose:
This project is part of Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development. The goal of Phase-1 is to
build a Python-based in-memory Todo console application using STRICT Spec-Driven
Development. This phase focuses on discipline, architecture thinking, and agent control —
NOT speed or manual coding.

Core Principles (Non-Negotiable):

1. Spec-Driven Development ONLY
   - No code may be written before specs are finalized.
   - The workflow MUST always be:
     Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
   - If something is unclear, the
      - refactor architecture without spec update
    - If conflict exists:
      Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks

Success Definition:
Phase-1 is successful ONLY if:
- All basic Todo features work correctly
- The entire app runs in memory
- All code is generated from specs
- The spec history clearly shows evolution

This Constitution applies ONLY to Phase-1.
Future phases may extend or overagent must STOP and request spec updates.

2. Zero Manual Coding
   - Humans are NOT allowed to write application code.
   - All code must be generated by AI via /sp.implement.
   - Humans may only edit specs, not source files.

3. Phase-1 Scope Lock
   - Storage MUST be in-memory only (no files, no database).
   - CLI / Console application ONLY.
   - No web, no API, no authentication, no AI chatbot.

4. Simplicity over Cleverness
   - Use clean, readable Python.
   - Avoid over-engineering.
   - Prefer simple data structures (lists, dicts).

5. Deterministic Behavior
   - Same input must always produce the same output.
   - No randomness, no side effects beyond in-memory state.

6. Task Identity & Traceability
   - Every code file must map to a Task ID.
   - Every Task must map back to a spec section.
   - No "extra features" outside specs.

7. Python Standards
   - Python version: 3.13+
   - Follow clean code principles.
   - Clear function boundaries.
   - Meaningful variable and function names.

8. CLride rules via new constitutions.
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution file with all the required principles for the Phase-1 Todo In-Memory Console App project. The constitution now includes:
- Spec-Driven Development ONLY
- Zero Manual Coding
- Phase-1 Scope Lock
- Simplicity over Cleverness
- Deterministic Behavior
- Task Identity & Traceability
- Python Standards
- CLI Rules
- Success Definition
- Development Workflow
- Governance

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution file updated with project-specific principles
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create feature specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now properly reflects the project requirements and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create feature specification
