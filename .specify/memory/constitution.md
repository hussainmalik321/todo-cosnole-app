# Phase-1 Todo In-Memory Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development ONLY
No code may be written before specs are finalized. The workflow MUST always be: Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement. If something is unclear, the agent must STOP and request spec updates. If conflict exists: Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks.

### II. Zero Manual Coding
Humans are NOT allowed to write application code. All code must be generated by AI via /sp.implement. Humans may only edit specs, not source files.

### III. Phase-1 Scope Lock
Storage MUST be in-memory only (no files, no database). CLI / Console application ONLY. No web, no API, no authentication, no AI chatbot.

### IV. Simplicity over Cleverness
Use clean, readable Python. Avoid over-engineering. Prefer simple data structures (lists, dicts).

### V. Deterministic Behavior
Same input must always produce the same output. No randomness, no side effects beyond in-memory state.

### VI. Task Identity & Traceability
Every code file must map to a Task ID. Every Task must map back to a spec section. No "extra features" outside specs.

### VII. Python Standards
Python version: 3.13+. Follow clean code principles. Clear function boundaries. Meaningful variable and function names.

### VIII. CLI Rules
All application logic must be accessible through command-line interface. Follow standard CLI conventions for input/output. Support clear user interaction patterns for all Todo operations.

## Success Definition
Phase-1 is successful ONLY if: All basic Todo features work correctly, The entire app runs in memory, All code is generated from specs, The spec history clearly shows evolution.

## Development Workflow
- Use the Spec-Driven Development workflow exclusively
- All changes must be traced back to specification requirements
- No feature implementation without prior spec documentation
- Maintain strict separation between specification and implementation phases

## Governance
This Constitution applies ONLY to Phase-1. Future phases may override rules via new constitutions. All development activities must comply with these principles. Amendments require explicit documentation and approval process.
